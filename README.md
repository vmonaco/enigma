enigma
======

A virtual Enigma encryption machine, similar to those used in WWII except more configurable. Also, a cryptanalysis attack on the cipher produced by the machine. Perhaps as Turing would have carried out if he had access to the digital computers today. Small project to commemorate Turing's 100th birthday.
